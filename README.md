# Pollr

Pollr is a decision-making app that creates polls for a group to collectively make a democratic decision.

## Problem

Suppose your group is stubbornly debating on who is the best Avenger. Everyone have their own separate opinions and ranking on who is the best. No consensus can be made amongst your group.

## Solution

Use Pollr to create a poll on what to eat tonight. Pollr uses [Borda Count](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Borda_count) to allocate points to each option based on the rank given by the voter. Once everyone in your group participates in the poll, check the results to see the top choice.
